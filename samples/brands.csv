Trained as a milliner and dressmaker in Paris, Lanvin's entrance into the fashion world began with the beautiful clothing she made for her daughter, Marguerite. People began inquiring about where they could purchase this clothing, and Lanvin joined the <i>Syndicat de la Couture</i> (""Union of Sewing"") in 1909. It wasn't long before she made the switch from clothing children to clothing their mothers.</p><p>Famous for her fashionable garments and matching mother-and-daughter ensembles, Lanvin's empire expanded to include a dye factory, home decor, menswear, furs and undergarments.</p><p>Lanvin's most notable achievement took place after she expanded her company to include Lanvin Parfums SA in 1924. The company's first perfume, My Sin, was launched in 1924. The company's most successful fragrance, Arpège (named after daughter Marguerite's arpeggios during piano practice) was launched to great success in 1927, and remains an enduring classic, still in production today.</p><p>Jeanne Lanvin passed away in 1946, and daughter Marguerite took the helm.

b5|Hermès|https://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Hermes.html|https://fimgs.net/mdimg/dizajneri/o.69.jpg|France|Accessories|https://www.hermes.com/||<p>Hermès is a French luxury goods house founded in 1837 by Thierry Hermes. Originally focused on equestrian accessories, the company has evolved over time into leather handbags, scarves, accessories, fashion and fragrance.</p><p>For Hermès, the perfume adventure begins in 1951 with Eau d’Hermès, composed by Edmond Roudnitska, one of the greatest creative spirits of the world of fragrances.</p><p>Ten years later, the birth of Calèche, the establishment’s first women’s perfume, confirmed the involvement of Hermès in the craft of perfume creation. Since then, fragrance has followed fragrance, each signed by the great names of perfume design. The arrival of Jean-Claude Ellena, in 2004, as the in-house perfumer for Hermès, was a decisive step. As an artist of olfactory emotion, an aesthete who goes beyond scale and material, he shares Hermès' sense of craftsmanship and expertise.</p><p>The encounter between Edmond Roudnitska and Émile Hermès (grandson of founder Thierry Hermès) gave birth to Eau d’Hermès, which remains one of the crowning glories of French perfumery.</p><p>In 1961, at the prompting of Jean-René Guerrand (son-in-law of Émile Hermès and founder of the fragrances branch), the perfumer Guy Robert composed Calèche, a masterpiece which instantly transformed Hermès into one of the major players of modern perfumery. Nine years later, moreover, he would be the author of Équipage, the House's first perfume for men.</p><p>The most recent encounter with Jean-Claude Ellena, was embodied in the creation of Un Jardin en Méditerranée in 2003, and then in 2004 with his official appointment as exclusive perfumer of the House. Since then, the deep affinity that has been established between the perfume designer and Hermès has continued to bear fruit, as if confirming the essential rightness of their mutual involvement. Jean-Claude Ellena is both heir and creator of a genealogy now structured into four territories of olfactive expression: the Colognes, the Garden-Perfumes, the Novel-Perfumes and the Hermessence collection.</p><p>Designer <b>Hermès</b> has <b>137</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

Guerlain has always used luxurious and rare materials for its perfumes, such as French vanilla or ylang-ylang from their own plantations in Comoro Islands. Beside that, Guerlain has been an innovator in use of synthetic materials: Jicky (1889) was the first perfume to which Aimé Guerlain added a synthetic component—coumarin.</p><p>The Guerlain house was founded by Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain in 1828. Starting with common hygiene products, Guerlain was also creating perfumes for his customers, and over time he developed the business into a highly successful company that became an official perfumer for several European royal courts.</p><p>After he died, his son Aimé Guerlain became the main perfumer. His famous perfume Jicky, created in 1889, became the first ""modern"" perfume. It is also believed that it was he who created the so-called ""Guerlinade""—the Guerlain signature base notes used for creation of multiple Guerlain perfumes.</p><p>His nephew Jacques Guerlain was the next nose of the Guerlain house. He created some of the most well-known perfumes of the house, including L'Heure Bleue (1912), Mitsouko (1919) and Shalimar (1925), which is one of the best loved perfumes of all time.</p><p>Jean-Paul Guerlain is the grandson of Jacques Guerlain. He first assisted, and then created his first ""solo"" offering, the now-famous Vetiver (1959). His other well-known creations include Habit Rouge, Chamade, Eau de Guerlain and Nahema.</p><p>The Guerlain perfume house was a family business until 1994, when it was acquired by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH). In 2002, the family legacy of Guerlain ended with Jean-Paul Guerlain's retirement, though he continues to work for the house as a consultant. Thierry Wasser was named the official in-house perfumer of Guerlain in 2008.</p><p>The flagship Guerlain boutique in Paris was thoroughly renovated and reopened in June 2005. The house at the magic address 68 Champs Elysées, now not only a boutique and the main office but a museum as well, welcomes customers again.</p><p>Designer <b>Guerlain</b> has <b>564</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

Born in Switzerland and destined for a career in finance, Piguet chose to depart for Paris at age 17, against his family's wishes, to pursue a career in fashion. Piguet found employment at Redfern, and then with influential early 20th century fashion designer Paul Poiret.</p><p>With experience at two important fahion houses under his belt, Piguet struck out on his own in 1933. His fashions for women were elegant in their simplicity, perfectly cut, reserved and conservative for daytime and colorful and flamboyant for nighttime. By 1938, Piguet's success enabled the opening of a new luxuruious salon on the Champs Elysses. Piguet's personal charm and aristocratic manner made him the toast of the wealthy elite as well as the arts and theatrical crowd. During his period of greatest success, Piguet employed some of the 20th century's best-known fashion designers before they rose to fame. Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Balmain, Christian Dior and James Galanos all took a turn at the house of Piguet. Piguet's fashion house was tremendously successful until it closed in 1951, and his influence on women's fashions lives on through the designers he helped train and through the iconic perfumes launched under the Robert Piguet brand.</p><p>Piguet met famed perfumer Germaine Cellier in the 1940s and worked with her to create perfumes that suited his elegant and modern post-war fashions. The first scent, Bandit, a leathery chypre launched in 1944, was introduced in conjunction with Piguet's runway collection that featured women in masks, with toy guns and knives, evoking a ""bad boy"" image.</p><p>The pair collaborated again on 1945's Visa (along with Jean Charles) and 1947's Fracas, deemed by many to be the quintessential tuberose fragrance.</p><p>Baghari was introduced in 1950, and was the last fragrance created before Piguet's death in 1953. The fashion house closed in 1951, but the Robert Piguet brand name continued to launch fragrances into the 1960s, with Cravache and Futur.</p><p>Ownership of the Robert Piguet brand and fragrances changed hands several times before reaching Fashion Fragrances &amp; Cosmetics in the 1990s. They sought to reintroduce the Piguet brand name as a luxury fragrance brand, and to offer versions of the original fragrances that adhered as closely as possible to the formulas and fragrances of the original scents, using modern ingredients and with slight updates for modern sensibilities. As a result, many of the classic Piguet fragrances have been made available again to the public, and new scents under the Piguet name have also been introduced.</p> <p>Designer <b>Robert Piguet</b> has <b>45</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

From 1925 until 1953, when the haute couture division closed its doors, Marcel Rochas dressed women in forward-thinking fashions that also celebrated traditional feminine silhouettes. Anticipating the needs of modern women in the early-to-mid 20th century, Rochas was the first to design 2/3-length coats and skirts with pockets. He also created the ""mermaid"" dress, which continues to inspire women's dress designs today.</p><p>The company expanded its offerings to include fragrances, starting with a trio of perfumes, Avenue Matignon, Air Jeune and Audace, in 1934. The perfumes were taken off the market during World War II, but the company's most famous fragrance, the classic Femme, was launched in 1943 and remains a perennial best-seller. Rochas was an early adapter of the cross-sale and marketed lipstick and stockings as companion pieces to Femme. The company's first men's fragrance, Moustache, was launched in 1949.</p><p>The Rochas fragrance and cosmetics division was an enormous success, and Marcel Rochas closed the haute couture division in 1953, before passing away in 1955. With fragrances now the main focus, Rochas' young wife Helene, who was just 30 years old at the time of his death, took the helm and turned the house of Rochas into a multi-million-dollar company before selling it in 1971.</p><p>The company changed hands several times during the late 20th century. Helene Rochas even returned as a consultant from 1984 to 1989. Proctor and Gamble acquired the company in 2003, and re-launched the fashion division, under the direction of Olivier Theyskens from 2003 to 2006. A two-year hiatus followed, with the fashion company launching yet again in 2008 under its current creative director, Marco Zanini.</p><p>Fragrances remain the most important product of the Rochas brand, and Rochas has employed its own in-house perfumer, Jean-Michel Duriez, since 2008.</p> <p>Designer <b>Rochas</b> has <b>81</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

With no formal training as a perfumer, but with a love for perfume instilled by his mother and a very talented nose, Daltroff set about creating what would go on to be one of the most enduring and beloved perfumes houses in the history of the fragrance industry.</p><p>The story of Parfums Caron is a story of secret love. Daltroff hired a former dressmaker, Felicie Wanpouille, to be the company's artistic adviser. Wanpouille oversaw the company's bottle design and packaging, and played an integral part in the company's success. Wanpouille was Daltroff's muse, and Daltroff was rumored to be smitten with her but never formally declared his love for her. The pair's great success and tremendous ambition, as well as the emotional undercurrents in their personal and professional relationship, resulted in some of the 20th century's most innovative and beloved perfumes.</p><p>Narcisse Noir (1911) was the first scent from the house to gain notoriety. This iconic fragrance was later immortalized in the film ""Sunset Boulevard,"" cradled in the hands of screen siren Gloria Swanson. N'Aimez Que Moi (""Love No One But Me"") is said by some to be a secret expression of affection between Daltroff and Wanpouille. (It's 1916 release also made it appropriate for soldiers to give their sweethearts as a forget-me-not.) Tabac Blond, introduced in 1919, was designed for the new style of woman emerging at the time—one who wasn't afraid to flaunt social conventions of the day by smoking cigarettes in public.</p><p>Many are not as familiar with the other great product of this perfume house, a finely-milled luxury face powder, first introduced in the 1930s and still available today. The powder's manufacturing process is a closely-guarded secret.</p><p>With World War II and the Nazi's approaching, Daltroff, who was Jewish, fled to America to escape persecution, leaving Caron in Wanpouille's very capable hands. Daltroff never returned to Europe and passed away in 1947.</p><p>Wanpouille kept the house going, introducing new perfumes in collaboration with other perfumers and overseeing operations until her own death in 1967.</p><p>Patrick Alès purchased Caron in 1998, Alès Groupe has sold the storied French fragrance house to Cattleya Finance, the private-investment holding company of Benjamin and Ariane de Rothschild, in 2018.</p> <p>Designer <b>Caron</b> has <b>133</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.
