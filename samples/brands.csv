The company's first sales brochure was published in 1896.

The California Perfume Company filed for its first ""Avon"" trademark on a beauty product in 1932, and officially changed its name to Avon in 1939.</p><p>Avon became a publicly-traded stock company in 1946, and expanded its business around the world over the second half of the 20th century.</p><p>In 2011, the company celebrated 125 years of business and has over six million sales representatives operating in more than 100 countries today. The company remains relevant in today's market through its use of technology for its products and for marketing, and has reached a new generation of customers through its use of celebrity spokesmodels such as Reese Witherspoon, Courtney Cox and Patrick Dempsey.</p><p>Avon expanded its offering to the youth market with the introduction of a new brand, mark, in 2003.</p><p>Perfumes have long been a staple in the Avon line, from the California Perfume Company's ""Little Dot Set"" of fragrances to the celebrity-endorsed fragrances offered by the company in the 21st century.</p> <p>Designer <b>Avon</b> has <b>1349</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

b627|Zara|https://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Zara.html|https://fimgs.net/mdimg/dizajneri/o.642.jpg|Spain|Fashion|https://www.zara.es|Inditex|"<p>Zara is a Spanish clothing and accessories brand based in Arteixo, Galicia. It was founded by Amancio Ortega and Rosalía Mera. They opened the first Zara store in 1975, and their original product line featured inexpensive lookalike products of popular designer fashions. The store was highly successful, and Ortega began opening more Zara stores throughout Spain.</p><p>During the 1980s, Ortega started changing the design, manufacturing, and distribution process of Zara to enable quick production of fashions in response to current trends. The company took advantage of improvements in information technology, and the economy of scale achieved by using groups of designers. Ortega describes his method and the company's offerings as ""instant fashions."" How quickly a design can be turned out is rumored to be just two weeks, from development to placement in stores. This contrasts sharply with the six-month industry average. As a result of its streamlined processes, Zara is able to launch around thousands of new designs each year. The rapid appearance and disappearance of a given design builds excitement in Zara's customers.</p><p>Zara has resisted the industry-wide trend towards transferring fast fashion production to inexpensive foreign labor. Zara is part of the Inditex group, which was founded in 1985 as the primary holding company of Zara's enterprises. Inditex is one of the world's largest distribution companies, which is integral to Zara's ""instant fashion"" concept, and also serves other retailers held by Inditex.</p><p>Another unusual strategy was Zara's policy of zero advertising. Funds that most businesses invest in advertising are instead set aside for the opening of new stores.</p><p>In 1980, the company started its international expansion, opening a store in Porto, Portugal. In 1989 it entered the United States and in 1990, it expanded to France, in the first of a series of international expansions in the decade. As of 2011, Zara has retail presence in 78 countries.</p><p>Zara stores are company-owned unless local legislation forbids foreign-owned businesses. Zara franchises their stores in these markets.</p><p>Zara expanded into home goods in 2003, and began offering fragrances, in collaboration with esteemed Spanish perfume house Puig, starting in 1998.</p> <p>Designer <b>Zara</b> has <b>1158</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

The company was started in San Francisco by Roy Raymond in 1977. Originally designed with the intent of making lingerie shopping a comfortable experience for men, Victoria's Secret has grown into a lingerie empire with more than 1,000 stores across the U.S. and select countries around the world. The company's growth as a retailer expanded significantly after it was sold to Limited Brands in 1982.</p><p>Beginning in 1995, the company has held an annual fashion show, broadcast on television and featuring top models (known as ""Runway Angels"") sporting its lingerie and clothing collections, set to lights and music and incorporating fantasy elements such as angel's wings. Victoria's Secret spokesmodels are also referred to as ""Angels"" and have included famed beauties such as Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen, Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Laetitia Casta. Angels also refers to a line of clothing in the brand, along with Very Sexy, Body and Pink.</p><p> The company offers fragrances and perfumed body care products named for its clothing lines, as well as other romance-themed and lingerie-themed fragrance collections. An early line of botanical-themed body care products was successful, and some remain for sale today, such as Pear Glace. In the late 1980s, the company made a more formal venture into the perfume market. The company's earliest perfume, Victoria, was launched in 1989. The very successful Dream Angels line was launched in 2000 and is updated on a regular basis with limited editions and flankers.</p> <p>Designer <b>Victoria's Secret</b> has <b>1061</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

Guerlain has always used luxurious and rare materials for its perfumes, such as French vanilla or ylang-ylang from their own plantations in Comoro Islands. Beside that, Guerlain has been an innovator in use of synthetic materials: Jicky (1889) was the first perfume to which Aimé Guerlain added a synthetic component—coumarin.</p><p>The Guerlain house was founded by Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain in 1828. Starting with common hygiene products, Guerlain was also creating perfumes for his customers, and over time he developed the business into a highly successful company that became an official perfumer for several European royal courts.</p><p>After he died, his son Aimé Guerlain became the main perfumer. His famous perfume Jicky, created in 1889, became the first ""modern"" perfume. It is also believed that it was he who created the so-called ""Guerlinade""—the Guerlain signature base notes used for creation of multiple Guerlain perfumes.</p><p>His nephew Jacques Guerlain was the next nose of the Guerlain house. He created some of the most well-known perfumes of the house, including L'Heure Bleue (1912), Mitsouko (1919) and Shalimar (1925), which is one of the best loved perfumes of all time.</p><p>Jean-Paul Guerlain is the grandson of Jacques Guerlain. He first assisted, and then created his first ""solo"" offering, the now-famous Vetiver (1959). His other well-known creations include Habit Rouge, Chamade, Eau de Guerlain and Nahema.</p><p>The Guerlain perfume house was a family business until 1994, when it was acquired by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH). In 2002, the family legacy of Guerlain ended with Jean-Paul Guerlain's retirement, though he continues to work for the house as a consultant. Thierry Wasser was named the official in-house perfumer of Guerlain in 2008.</p><p>The flagship Guerlain boutique in Paris was thoroughly renovated and reopened in June 2005.

The history of Dzintars begins in the middle of the 19th century.</p><p></p><p>A. Briger’s soap and perfumery factory was founded in Riga in 1849, producing soap, candles, and making perfume and Eau de Cologne using ready-made compositions from France. In the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, multiple small perfumery and cosmetics companies had sprung up in various Latvian towns. In 1940, several companies in the area were nationalized and transformed to soap and perfumery factory Sarcana Ausma (the former A. Briger’s factory), chemical, candle and tube factory Metra, perfumery factory Flora and tube-cosmetics factory Rota. From 1947 to 1951 the perfumery and cosmetics manufacturers were again reorganized, and Flora and Rota were liquidated in favor of larger companies Sarcana Ausma and Metra. In June 1951, the factory known as Metra was renamed as Dzintars. In 1958 Dzintars merged with soap factory Sarcana Ausma. The merged company retained the Dzintars name.</p><p></p><p>Production volume increased over time as a result of automation and mechanization. A new facility on the extreme edge of Riga was built, and core operations were moved into the new building in 1969. New equipment and mechanization in the early 1970s enabled the preparation and pouring of perfumery and cosmetic liquids, manufacturing of aluminum tubes, and preparation and packaging of creams and toothpastes. In January, 1976 the factory Dzintars changed its legal status as Riga’s Manufacturing Union of perfumery and cosmetics industry Dzintars. In October 1991, a decision was made to establish Dzintars as a Joint Stock Company, which was formalized by certificate on November 7, 1991. Today, having walked a long path of development and changes, the Dzintars company has become the largest manufacturer of biocosmetics and perfumery in the Baltics.</p> <p>Designer <b>Dzintars</b> has <b>473</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.
