He entered the fashion business working for Robert Piguet, and later worked at Lucien Lelong with another up-and-coming designer, Pierre Balmain. Dior introduced the ""New Look"" in 1947. It represented a radical departure from the simple, fabric-conserving styles of World War II and was hugely influential in women's fashion, as well as helping to re-establish Paris as a fashion capital of the world.</p><p>The house of Dior issued perfumes to match its new fashions, launching company Parfums Dior and its first fragrance in 1947: Miss Dior, named for the designer's sister Catherine.</p><p>Christian Dior passed away in 1957, but the fashion and perfume houses that bear his name live on. The Dior brand name is known worldwide for its haute couture collections, luxurious ready-to-wear fashions, cosmetics and fragrances. Today, Christian Dior is also the main holding company of multi-national luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.</p> <p>Designer <b>Dior</b> has <b>309</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.

The house and designer are often abbreviated as YSL.</p><p>Laurent's career in fashion began at the tender age of 17, when he served as assistant to Christian Dior. With Dior's death four years later, Laurent was named head of the house of Dior at just 21 years of age. Still a young man when the Algerian War of Independence broke out, Laurent was drafted into the army in 1960 and lost his position at Dior. Military service and despair over the loss of his design position resulted in a hospital stay. After a brief period of recuperation, Laurent started his own fashion company and went on to become one of the most influential fashion designers of the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>Laurent became known for his exquisitely-tailored women's suits, and is credited with creating the first women's tuxedo. The first designer to announce his expansion from couture into ready-to-wear, he is credited with making chic ready-to-wear fashions available to the mass market, and for making ready-to-wear a reputable business for designers. Laurent's ready-to-wear line was sold in boutiques named <em>Rive Gauche</em>, which would later be commemorated with a perfume.</p><p>Yves Saint Laurent remained active as the collection's main designer through the late 1980s. After his retirement, a series of designers including Alber Elbaz, Tom Ford and Stefano Pilati have produced collections for the brand. Yves Saint Laurent passed away in 2008.</p><p>Cosmetics and perfumes have long been included in the designer's offerings. The house's first fragrance, Y for women, was launched in 1964. Y and several other launches by YSL, including Rive Gauche (1970), Opium (1977), men's scent Kourous (1981), and Paris (1983) have become modern classics of the perfume world and remain best-sellers. The company continues to earn new fans with contemporary releases such as Baby Doll (2000), Elle (2007) and La Nuit de l'Homme (2009).

Initially trained as an architect at Parsons School of Design, Ford spent a year working abroad at an internship for fashion house Chloé and developed a feel for the fashion industry.</p><p>Ford concealed his architecture background and displayed considerable personal charm in his pursuit of a job in the fashion industry. His first position was with American designer Cathy Hardwick. He accepted a position with Perry Ellis, but knew better prospects were available in Europe. Prestigious Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling at the time, and Ford accepted a position in Gucci's women's Ready-to-Wear division in 1990. Ford achieved considerable success at Gucci, eventually heading up multiple divisions before being named Creative Director in 1992. Ford's efforts were pivotal in Gucci's turn-around. The company was nearly bankrupt when Ford joined the organization, but when he left in 2004, the company's value had more than doubled. During Ford's tenure with Gucci, the company acquired Yves Saint Laurent, and Ford created provocative, controversial and highly successful ad campagins for YSL fragrances Opium and M7. These ads were an early indicator of Ford's future direction.</p><p>Tom Ford returned to the U.S. and announced the creation of his own brand in 2005. The company offers fashions, accessories and eyewear, and is known for its sexually-charged advertising. Ford also formed a partnership with Estee Lauder that same year, for the development of fragrances and cosmetics. The first fragrance produced under this alliance, Black Orchid (2006) was an immediate success. A series of successful fragrances for men and women have since been launched, along with a prestige line, Tom Ford Private Blend, whose first fragrance was Purple Patchouli in 2007.</p><p>Ford's career took an unusual turn in 2009 when he directed his first film, ""A Single Man,"" which was well-received by critics and filmgoers and earned a number of awards and nominations for the director and actors.</p> <p>Designer <b>Tom Ford</b> has <b>138</b> perfumes in our fragrance base.
